# Text Cleanup Skill

Systematic approach to identifying and removing AI-generated verbosity patterns while preserving technical accuracy and meaning.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Slop Patterns (AI Conversational Filler)

#### Precondition Preambles
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "Certainly!",
    "Of course!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I'd be happy to help!",
    "Great question!",
    "That's a great question",
    "Sure thing!",
    "Definitely!",
    "I can certainly help with that"
  ],
  "context": "start_conversation",
  "removal": "complete"
}
```

#### Hedging Language
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "It's worth noting that",
    "Keep in mind that",
    "Generally speaking",
    "Typically",
    "In most cases",
    "As you may know",
    "It's important to understand",
    "Usually",
    "Often",
    "Normally",
    "For the most part"
  ],
  "context": "uncertainty_qualifier",
  "removal": "conditional" // Remove if no real uncertainty present
}
```

#### Excessive Politeness
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "Please let me know if you need anything else",
    "Feel free to ask if you have questions",
    "I hope this helps!",
    "Don't hesitate to reach out",
    "Happy to help further",
    "Let me know if that works for you"
  ],
  "context": "conversational_closing",
  "removal": "complete"
}
```

#### Verbose Transitions
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "Now, let's move on to",
    "With that said",
    "Having established that",
    "Building on the above",
    "As mentioned earlier",
    "Next, I'll",
    "Moving forward",
    "Additionally",
    "Furthermore",
    "Moreover"
  ],
  "context": "transition_filler",
  "removal": "conditional" // Keep if transition is meaningful
}
```

### 2. Code Comment Patterns

#### Redundant Function Descriptions
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "// This function calculates the sum",
    "// The following function returns",
    "// This method does the following",
    "// Function to calculate",
    "// Helper function for",
    "// Utility function that"
  ],
  "matches_when": [
    "function name already describes action",
    "comment repeats signature"
  ],
  "replacement": "Keep only additional context not in function name"
}
```

#### Self-Evident Comments
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "// The following code",
    "// Here we are",
    "// This is where we",
    "// Now we will",
    "// At this point",
    "// This section contains"
  ],
  "removal": "complete",
  "exception": "Keep if adds architectural context"
}
```

### 3. Documentation Patterns

#### Conversational Openers
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "Welcome to the documentation for",
    "In this guide, we'll explore",
    "Let's dive into",
    "Getting started with",
    "This document will walk you through"
  ],
  "removal": "complete",
  "replacement": "Direct topic introduction"
}
```

#### Redundant Explanations
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "As the name suggests, this function",
    "As you can see from the code above",
    "The code below shows",
    "In the example provided",
    "This implementation uses"
  ],
  "context": "obvious_explanation",
  "removal": "conditional" // Keep if adds genuine clarification
}
```

## Cleanup Techniques

### Pattern Matching Algorithm

1. **Tokenize** input into sentences/phrases
2. **Pattern Lookup** against comprehensive database
3. **Context Analysis** to determine removal safety
4. **Confidence Scoring** for each potential removal
5. **Human Review** recommendations for borderline cases

### Context Preservation Rules

#### Always Preserve
- Technical specifications and constraints
- Numeric values, formulas, and calculations  
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Architectural decisions and rationales
- Security considerations and warnings
- Performance-critical information

#### Remove When Safe
- Conversational padding without informational value
- Redundant explanations of obvious concepts
- Excessive politeness that adds no meaning
- Verbose transitions to unrelated topics

#### Conditional Removal
- Hedging language when statement is factual and certain
- Explanations that might be valuable to beginners
- Historical context when establishing background

### Quality Metrics

#### Effectiveness Measures
```typescript
interface CleanupMetrics {
  beforeStats: {
    wordCount: number;
    characterCount: number;
    sentenceCount: number;
  };
  afterStats: {
    wordCount: number;
    characterCount: number;  
    sentenceCount: number;
  };
  patternsRemoved: {
    slopPatterns: number;
    redundantComments: number;
    verbosePhrases: number;
  };
  qualityScore: number; // 0-1, higher is better
  meaningPreservationScore: number; // 0-1, closer to 1 is better
}
```

#### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
function calculateQualityScore(metrics: CleanupMetrics): number {
  const concisenessRatio = metrics.afterStats.wordCount / metrics.beforeStats.wordCount;
  const patternRemovalEffectiveness = Math.min(
    metrics.patternsRemoved.slopPatterns / 10, // Normalized
    metrics.patternsRemoved.redundantComments / 5,
    metrics.patternsRemoved.verbosePhrases / 8
  );
  
  // Penalize if meaning preservation is low
  const meaningPenalty = 1 - metrics.meaningPreservationScore;
  
  return concisenessRatio * patternRemovalEffectiveness * (1 - meaningPenalty);
}
```

## Implementation Patterns

### For Commands
Structure cleanup operations as:

```
/clean [input] --mode=[slop|comments|docs|all] [--preview] [--apply]
```

**Example workflows:**
```bash
# Preview slop removal
/clean "Certainly! I'd be happy to help optimize this query..." --slop --preview

# Apply comment cleanup to file
/clean src/database.ts --comments --apply

# Clean entire documentation directory
/clean docs/ --docs --aggressive --apply

# All-purpose cleanup with confirmation
/clean "..." --all --preview --apply
```

### For Agents

Use pattern matching with context awareness:

```markdown
## Text Cleanup Protocol

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Scan input for pattern matches
- Categorize findings by type
- Assess removal safety in context
- Generate confidence scores

### 2. Strategy Phase  
- Select aggressiveness level based on user preference
- Identify preservation requirements
- Plan sequence of operations

### 3. Execution Phase
- Apply approved modifications
- Maintain technical accuracy
- Provide before/after comparison
- Document all changes made
```

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Learning
Track successful removals to improve future matching:
```json
{
  "learnedPatterns": {
    "context": "technical_explanation",
    "pattern": "As can be seen from the implementation",
    "removalRate": 0.85,
    "feedbackScore": 4.2
  }
}
```

### User Customization
Allow personal pattern databases:
```json
{
  "userPatterns": {
    "keepPhrases": ["critical", "essential", "must"],
    "removePhrases": ["just", "basically", "simply"],
    "contextExceptions": ["educational", "onboarding"]
  }
}
```

### Integration Modes

- **Git Integration**: Clean commit messages, PR descriptions, diffs
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time code comment suggestions  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated documentation cleanup
- **API Integration**: Batch processing capabilities

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Effectiveness
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with gentle cleanup, increase gradually
2. **Preview First**: Always show changes before applying
3. **Context Matters**: Technical documentation may need more verbosity
4. **Preserve Intent**: Never remove meaning for brevity
5. **Iterative**: Multiple passes with different aggressiveness levels

### Quality Assurance
- Verify technical content remains unchanged
- Ensure code still compiles and functions
- Confirm documentation still serves its purpose
- Check that examples and warnings are preserved
