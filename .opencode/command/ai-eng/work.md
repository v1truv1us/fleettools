# Work Command

Execute a plan or task: $ARGUMENTS

> **Phase 4 of Spec-Driven Workflow**: Research → Specify → Plan → Work → Review

## Quick Start

```bash
/ai-eng/work "specs/auth/plan.yaml"
/ai-eng/work --from-plan=plans/auth.yaml --continue
/ai-eng/work "FEAT-001" --dry-run
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--from-plan <path>` | Path to plan file to execute |
| `--continue` | Resume interrupted work |
| `--validate-only` | Run validation without implementation |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be done without executing |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose output |

## Phase 0: Prompt Refinement (CRITICAL - Do First)

**You MUST invoke the `prompt-refinement` skill before proceeding.**

**How to invoke:**
1. Load the skill from: `skills/prompt-refinement/SKILL.md`
2. Use phase: `work`
3. Follow the TCRO framework: Task, Context, Requirements, Output

## Phase 1: Setup & Planning

### 1.1 Load Plan and Spec

**Load Plan:**
- If argument is a file path: Load from `specs/[feature]/plan.md`
- If argument is a task ID: Find in `specs/[feature]/plan.md` or recent plans
- If `--continue`: Resume from last incomplete task
- Extract all tasks with dependencies and time estimates

**Load Specification (if exists):**
- Check for `specs/[feature]/spec.md` alongside to plan
- Extract user stories and acceptance criteria from spec
- Extract non-functional requirements
- Cross-reference with tasks to ensure all spec requirements are covered

**Example paths:**
```
specs/auth/
├── spec.md          # Load for validation
└── plan.md          # Load for tasks
```

### 1.2 Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feat/[feature-slug]
```

### 1.3 Optional: Create Git Worktree (for large features)
```bash
git worktree add --detach .worktrees/[feature-slug]
```
Use skill: `skills_devops_git_worktree`

### 1.4 Initialize Todo Tracking

Create a todo list from plan tasks:
- Map each task to a todo item
- Set status to `pending`
- Link to task ID and acceptance criteria
- Estimate total effort

**Example todo structure:**
```
[FEAT-001-A] Create SessionManager class
  Status: pending
  Priority: high
  Time: 30 min
  Depends: None
  Files: src/context/session.ts
```

---

## Phase 2: Task Execution Loop

For each task in dependency order:

### 2.1 Mark Task In Progress
```bash
# Update todo status
todo --mark-in-progress [TASK-ID]
```

### 2.2 Implement Changes
- Read existing code patterns from discovery phase
- Follow project conventions (naming, structure, style)
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep changes focused on task scope

**Quality Checkpoints During Implementation:**
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Types are explicit (no `any`)
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"

### 2.3 Write/Update Tests

For each file modified:

**Unit Tests** (if applicable):
```typescript
// tests/[module].test.ts
describe('[Component]', () => {
  it('should [behavior]', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  })
})
```

**Integration Tests** (if applicable):
- Test interactions with other modules
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify error scenarios

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Minimum 80% line coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests

### 2.4 Run Quality Gates (In Order)

#### Gate 1: Linting
```bash
bun run lint
```
**Must Pass**: No warnings or errors

If fails: Fix lint violations, re-commit

#### Gate 2: Type Checking
```bash
bun run type-check
```
**Must Pass**: No TypeScript errors

If fails: Fix type errors, re-commit

#### Gate 3: Unit Tests
```bash
bun run test:unit
```
**Must Pass**: All tests pass, coverage ≥80%

If fails: Fix tests or code, re-commit

#### Gate 4: Build
```bash
bun run build
```
**Must Pass**: No build errors or warnings

If fails: Fix build errors, re-commit

#### Gate 5: Integration Tests (if applicable)
```bash
bun run test:integration
```
**Must Pass**: All integration tests pass

If fails: Fix integration issues, re-commit

**NO TASK IS COMPLETE UNTIL ALL GATES PASS.**

### 2.5 Commit Changes
```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "[TASK-ID] Brief description

- Detailed change 1
- Detailed change 2

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2
"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- First line: `[TASK-ID] Action-oriented summary (50 chars max)`
- Blank line
- Body: Bullet points of what changed
- Blank line
- Acceptance Criteria: Checkboxes showing what's complete

### 2.6 Mark Task Complete
```bash
todo --mark-complete [TASK-ID]
```

---

## Phase 3: Validation & Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Run Full Test Suite
```bash
bun run test
```
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- Coverage meets thresholds

### 3.2 Run Full Build
```bash
bun run build
```
- No errors
- No warnings
- Output size acceptable

### 3.3 Type Safety Check
```bash
bun run type-check
```
- No implicit `any`
- All types explicit
- No unused variables

### 3.4 Lint Full Codebase
```bash
bun run lint
```
- No style violations
- Consistent formatting
- No unused imports

### 3.5 Performance Check (if applicable)
```bash
bun run benchmark
```
- No performance regressions
- Bundle size within limits
- Load times acceptable

### 3.6 Security Check (if applicable)
```bash
bun run audit
```
- No known vulnerabilities
- Dependencies up to date
- No security warnings

### 3.7 Specification Validation (if spec exists)

**Cross-Reference with Specification:**

1. **Load spec**: Read `specs/[feature]/spec.md`
2. **Verify coverage**: For each completed task, check:
   - Are all task acceptance criteria met?
   - Are related spec acceptance criteria satisfied?
3. **Update spec**: Mark completed user stories/tasks in spec.md

**Validation Checklist:**
```markdown
## Spec Validation

### Task → Spec Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Task ID | Task AC Met | Spec AC Met | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| TASK-001 | [x] | [x] | All criteria verified |
| TASK-002 | [x] | [ ] Missing AC-3, needs follow-up |


### User Story Status Update

Update spec.md to mark completed user stories:
```markdown
### US-001: User Registration
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003 done)
```

4. **Identify Gaps**: If spec acceptance criteria are not met:
   - Note which criteria are missing
   - Create follow-up tasks to address gaps
   - Update plan with new tasks if needed

**If validation fails:**
- Note which acceptance criteria are not met
- Determine if existing task can be enhanced or new task needed
- Create follow-up task(s) to address gaps

---

## Tracking & Metrics

### During Execution
- Track actual time vs. estimated time
- Note any blockers or issues
- Record decisions made

### After Completion
- Calculate total effort (sum of task times)
- Identify tasks that took longer than estimated
- Note patterns for future planning

### Metrics to Track
| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Estimated vs. Actual Time | Improve future estimates |
| Test Coverage | Ensure quality |
| Build Time | Identify bottlenecks |
| Commit Count | Measure granularity |
| Review Feedback | Improve code quality |

---

## Resuming Interrupted Work

If work is interrupted:

```bash
/work --continue
```

This will:
1. Find the last incomplete task
2. Show its status and acceptance criteria
3. Resume from where you left off
4. Maintain all previous progress

---

## Validation-Only Mode

To validate without implementing:

```bash
/work [plan-file] --validate-only
```

This will:
1. Check all files exist
2. Verify dependencies are resolvable
3. Run type checking on existing code
4. Identify potential issues
5. Report without making changes

---

## Dry-Run Mode

To see what would be done:

```bash
/work [plan-file] --dry-run
```

This will:
1. Show all tasks in order
2. Show dependencies
3. Show files to be modified
4. Show estimated total time
5. Ask for confirmation before proceeding

---

## Best Practices

### During Implementation
- ✅ Commit frequently (after each task)
- ✅ Keep commits focused and atomic
- ✅ Write descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Test as you go
- ✅ Ask for help early if stuck

### Quality Gates
- ✅ Never skip a quality gate
- ✅ Fix issues immediately
- ✅ Don't accumulate technical debt
- ✅ Maintain test coverage
- ✅ Keep build times reasonable

### Communication
- ✅ Update todos regularly
- ✅ Note blockers immediately
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Request review early
- ✅ Respond to feedback promptly

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- ❌ Don't skip tests
- ❌ Don't ignore lint warnings

2. Check test output for specific failures
3. Fix code or test as appropriate
4. Re-run tests

### "Build is slow"
1. Check build output: `bun run build --verbose`
2. Identify slow steps
3. Consider code splitting or optimization
4. Use `/optimize` command if needed

### "Too many files to modify"
1. Stop and commit current progress
2. Break remaining work into smaller tasks
3. Update plan with new tasks
4. Continue with next task

### "Unclear acceptance criteria"
1. Stop and ask for clarification
2. Don't guess or assume
3. Update plan with clarified criteria
4. Resume implementation

## Success Criteria

A work session is successful when:
- ✅ All tasks completed
- ✅ All quality gates passed
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ PR created and reviewed
- ✅ Code merged to main

## Execution

Execute a plan using:

```bash
bun run scripts/run-command.ts work "$ARGUMENTS" [options]
```

For example:
- `bun run scripts/run-command.ts work "specs/auth/plan.yaml" --verbose`
- `bun run scripts/run-command.ts work --from-plan=plans/auth.yaml --continue`
- `bun run scripts/run-command.ts work "FEAT-001" --dry-run`

## Integration

- Reads from `/ai-eng/plan` output (plan.yaml)
- Validates against `/ai-eng/specify` output (spec.md)
- Feeds into `/ai-eng/review` for code review
