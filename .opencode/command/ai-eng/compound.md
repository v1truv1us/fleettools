# Compound Command

Document a solved problem to build team knowledge over time.

## Process

1. **Gather context** about the problem and solution
2. **Create documentation** at `docs/solutions/[category]/[topic].md`
3. **Include:**
   - Problem description
   - Solution explanation
   - Code examples
   - Gotchas and edge cases
   - Related links
   - Date added
4. **Update docs index** to include the new solution

## Philosophy

Each solved problem should make future similar problems easier. This is compounding engineering - every unit of work improves the system for next time.
