# Plan Command

Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

> **Phase 3 of Spec-Driven Workflow**: Research → Specify → Plan → Work → Review

## Quick Start

```bash
# From description
/ai-eng/plan "implement user authentication with JWT"

# From specification
/ai-eng/plan --from-spec=specs/auth/spec.md

# From research
/ai-eng/plan --from-research=docs/research/2026-01-01-auth-patterns.md
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--swarm` | Use Swarms multi-agent orchestration |
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Plan scope (architecture\|implementation\|review\|full) [default: full] |
| `-r, --requirements <reqs...>` | List of requirements |
| `-c, --constraints <constraints...>` | List of constraints |
| `-o, --output <file>` | Output plan file [default: generated-plan.yaml] |
| `--from-spec <file>` | Create plan from specification file |
| `--from-research <file>` | Create plan from research document |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose output |

## Phase 0: Prompt Refinement (CRITICAL - Do First)

**You MUST invoke the `prompt-refinement` skill before proceeding.**

**How to invoke:**
1. Load the skill from: `skills/prompt-refinement/SKILL.md`
2. Use phase: `plan`
3. Follow the TCRO framework: Task, Context, Requirements, Output

If `--from-spec` flag is provided:
1. **Read specification** from `specs/[feature]/spec.md`
2. **Extract user stories** and their acceptance criteria
3. **Extract non-functional requirements** (security, performance, etc.)
4. **Identify open questions** marked with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`
5. **Use as foundation** for technical planning

If no spec is found:
- Warn user: "No specification found. Consider running `/ai-eng/specify` first to create a detailed specification."
- Offer: "Proceed with inline requirements gathering? (y/n)"
- If yes, gather requirements through clarifying questions
- If no, exit and prompt user to run `/ai-eng/specify`

### Phase 2: Discovery (Research Mode)

#### Subagent Communication Protocol (Minimal)

If you delegate discovery to subagents (recommended for large codebases), include a small Context Handoff Envelope in each Task prompt.

Use:

```text
<CONTEXT_HANDOFF_V1>
Goal: (1 sentence)
Scope: (codebase|docs|external|all)
Known constraints: (bullets; optional)
What I already checked: (bullets; optional)
Files/paths to prioritize: (bullets; optional)
Deliverable: (what you must return)
Output format: RESULT_V1
</CONTEXT_HANDOFF_V1>
```

And require:

```text
<RESULT_V1>
RESULT:
EVIDENCE:
OPEN_QUESTIONS:
NEXT_STEPS:
CONFIDENCE: 0.0-1.0
</RESULT_V1>
```

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Search for similar patterns and implementations
   - Identify existing conventions and styles
   - Map related files and dependencies
   - Document findings with file paths and line numbers

2. **Tech Stack Detection**
   - Identify frameworks, libraries, and tools in use
   - Check package.json/requirements/go.mod for dependencies
   - Note version constraints and compatibility requirements

3. **Scope Definition**
   - List all files that will be modified
   - List all new files to be created
   - Identify integration points with existing code
   - Flag potential breaking changes

### Phase 3: Technical Planning

#### From Specification (if exists)

For each user story in spec:
1. **Map to technical tasks**: Break user story into implementation tasks
2. **Define acceptance criteria**: Derive from spec acceptance criteria
3. **Apply technical constraints**: From spec's non-functional requirements

Example mapping:
```markdown
**User Story**: US-001 User Registration
→ Task REG-001: Create User database model
→ Task REG-002: Implement registration API endpoint
→ Task REG-003: Add email validation
→ Task REG-004: Implement password hashing
```

#### Inline Requirements (if no spec)

If proceeding without specification:
- Use clarifying questions to gather requirements
- Define technical approach
- Document assumptions and constraints

### Phase 4: Task Decomposition

Break the feature into **atomic tasks** using this hierarchy:

```
Epic (the full feature)
└── Phase (logical grouping, ~1 day)
    └── Task (atomic unit, ~30 min)
        └── Subtask (if task is still too large)
```

**Each atomic task MUST include:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| ID | Unique identifier | `FEAT-001-A` |
| Title | Action-oriented name | "Create SessionManager class" |
| Depends On | Blocking task IDs | `FEAT-001-B` (or "None") |
| Files | Exact files to modify/create | `src/context/session.ts` |
| Acceptance Criteria | Checkboxes that define "done" | `[ ] Class exports correctly` |
| Spec Reference | Links to user story/acceptance criteria | `US-001: AC-2` |
| Estimated Time | Time box | `30 min` |
| Complexity | Low / Medium / High | `Medium` |

### Phase 5: Generate Supporting Artifacts

Based on feature type and technical approach, generate:

#### data-model.md (if database involved)

```markdown
# Data Model

## Entities

### User
```typescript
{
  id: string (UUID, primary key)
  email: string (unique, indexed)
  password_hash: string (bcrypt)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```

## Relationships

- User has many Sessions
- Session belongs to User

## Indexes

- `users_email_unique` on (email) for uniqueness
- `users_created_at` for sorting
```

#### contracts/ (if API involved)

```markdown
# API Contracts

## POST /api/auth/register

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user_id": "uuid-here"
}
```

**Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid email format"
}
```
```

#### research.md (if technical decisions needed)

Document decisions made during planning:
- Technology choices with rationale
- Trade-offs considered
- Alternatives evaluated

### Phase 6: Risk Assessment

For each phase, identify:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| (risk description) | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | (strategy) |

### Phase 7: Testing Strategy

Define testing approach for each phase:

- **Unit Tests**: What functions/classes need tests?
- **Integration Tests**: What interactions need verification?
- **Manual Testing**: What scenarios to validate?
- **Regression Checks**: What existing functionality could break?

**Spec-driven validation**: Ensure all spec acceptance criteria have corresponding tests

## Post-Planning Actions

After generating the plan:

1. **Review with user** - Confirm scope and priorities
2. **Create GitHub issue** (optional) - Link to plan file
3. **Estimate total effort** - Sum of all task estimates
4. **Identify parallel tracks** - Tasks without dependencies that can run concurrently
5. **Validate spec coverage** (if spec exists) - Ensure all spec requirements are covered

## Tips for Effective Plans

- **Timeboxing**: If a task exceeds 60 minutes, break it down further
- **Dependencies**: Minimize cross-task dependencies to enable parallel work
- **Checkpoints**: Each phase should end with a working (possibly incomplete) state
- **Escape hatches**: Note where you could stop and still have value
- **Evidence-based**: Include file paths and code snippets from discovery
- **Spec-driven**: Ensure all spec acceptance criteria have corresponding task acceptance criteria

## Integration

### Feeds Into
- `/ai-eng/work` - Reads plan.md for task execution
- Validates task completion against spec.md acceptance criteria

### Reads From
- `specs/[feature]/spec.md` - User stories, acceptance criteria, NFRs
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project philosophy and constraints
- `docs/research/*.md` - Optional research context

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Plan from Existing Spec

```bash
# User provides feature name (spec already exists)
/ai-eng/plan --from-spec=specs/auth

# Step 0: Prompt refinement skill asks planning-specific questions
# Step 1: Loads spec from specs/auth/spec.md
# Step 2: Maps user stories to technical tasks
# Step 3: Generates plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/
# Step 4: Validates spec coverage
```

### Example 2: Plan Without Spec (Inline)

```bash
# User provides description without spec
/ai-eng/plan "implement JWT-based authentication"

# Step 0: Prompt refinement asks planning questions
# Step 1: Warns about missing spec, offers to proceed
# Step 2: Gathers requirements through clarification
# Step 3: Generates plan.md
```

## Best Practices

### Spec-Driven Planning

When specification exists:
1. **Map each user story to tasks**: Don't miss any requirements
2. **Trace acceptance criteria**: Each spec AC should have task AC
3. **Document decisions**: Why specific tech choices were made
4. **Mark dependencies**: Which tasks must come before others

### Cross-Reference

Always cross-reference between artifacts:
- Tasks reference user stories (US-001)
- Acceptance criteria reference spec acceptance criteria (AC-2)
- Data models reference user story requirements

### Task Independence

Ensure tasks are truly atomic:
- Can you complete it without touching unfinished sibling tasks?
- Is it testable in isolation?
- Does it have clear start and end states?

## Success Criteria

Successful planning achieves:
- ✅ All tasks are atomic and independently completable
- ✅ Dependencies are clearly documented
- ✅ All spec acceptance criteria are covered (if spec exists)
- ✅ Supporting artifacts generated (data-model, contracts)
- ✅ Risk assessment completed
- ✅ Testing strategy defined
- ✅ Ready to feed into `/ai-eng/work`

## Execution

After planning, execute the plan using:

```bash
bun run scripts/run-command.ts plan "$ARGUMENTS" [options]
```

For example:
- `bun run scripts/run-command.ts plan "implement auth" --from-spec=specs/auth/spec.md --output=plans/auth.yaml`
- `bun run scripts/run-command.ts plan --from-research=docs/research/auth.md --scope=implementation`

$ARGUMENTS
