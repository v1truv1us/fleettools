# Research Command

Conduct comprehensive research for: $ARGUMENTS

> **Phase 1 of Spec-Driven Workflow**: Research → Specify → Plan → Work → Review

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic research
/ai-eng/research "authentication patterns"

# With options
/ai-eng/research "api design" --scope codebase --depth deep --verbose

# Feed results into planning
/ai-eng/research "caching strategies" --feed-into plan
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--swarm` | Use Swarms multi-agent orchestration |
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Research scope (codebase\|documentation\|external\|all) [default: all] |
| `-d, --depth <depth>` | Research depth (shallow\|medium\|deep) [default: medium] |
| `-o, --output <file>` | Output file path |
| `-f, --format <format>` | Export format (markdown\|json\|html) [default: markdown] |
| `--no-cache` | Disable research caching |
| `--feed-into <command>` | After research, invoke specified command (specify\|plan) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose output |

## Phase 0: Prompt Refinement (CRITICAL - Do First)

You MUST invoke the `prompt-refinement` skill before proceeding. This transforms vague prompts into structured TCRO format.

**How to invoke the skill:**
1. Load the skill from: `skills/prompt-refinement/SKILL.md`
2. Use phase: `research`
3. Follow the TCRO framework: Task, Context, Requirements, Output

**TCRO Framework:**

| Element | Purpose | Key Question |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Task** | What's the job to be done? | "What specific outcome do you need?" |
| **Context** | Why does this matter? | "What's the broader system/goal?" |
| **Requirements** | What are the constraints? | "Must-haves vs nice-to-haves?" |
| **Output** | What format is needed? | "What should the deliverable look like?" |

**Process:**
1. Load CLAUDE.md from project root
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Structure into TCRO format
4. Apply incentive prompting (expert persona, stakes language, step-by-step reasoning)
5. Confirm with user before proceeding

## Phase 1: Context & Scope Definition

1. **Parse the Research Request**
   - Identify the primary research question
   - Decompose into 3-5 sub-questions
   - Define clear scope boundaries
   - Determine depth level required

2. **Read Primary Sources First**
   - NEVER spawn agents before understanding context
   - Read any referenced tickets or documents completely
   - Identify what information already exists

## Phase 2: Parallel Discovery

When spawning discovery agents, include a **Context Handoff Envelope**:

```
<CONTEXT_HANDOFF_V1>
Goal: (1 sentence)
Scope: (codebase|docs|external|all)
Known constraints: (bullets; optional)
What I already checked: (bullets; optional)
Files/paths to prioritize: (bullets; optional)
Deliverable: (what you must return)
Output format: RESULT_V1
</CONTEXT_HANDOFF_V1>
```

All agents must respond with:

```
<RESULT_V1>
RESULT:
EVIDENCE:
OPEN_QUESTIONS:
NEXT_STEPS:
CONFIDENCE: 0.0-1.0
</RESULT_V1>
```

**Spawn these agents CONCURRENTLY:**

| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| `codebase-locator` | Find all relevant files, components, and directories |
| `research-locator` | Discover existing documentation, decisions, and notes |
| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Identify recurring implementation patterns |

Wait for all discovery agents to complete before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Sequential Deep Analysis

Based on discovery results, run analyzers SEQUENTIALLY:

1. **`codebase-analyzer`** - Extract implementation details with file:line evidence
2. **`research-analyzer`** - Extract decisions, constraints, and insights from docs

For complex research, consider adding:
- `web-search-researcher` - External best practices and standards
- `system-architect` - Architectural implications
- `database-expert` - Data layer concerns
- `security-scanner` - Security assessment

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Documentation

Create a comprehensive research document saved to `docs/research/[date]-[topic-slug].md`:

```markdown
---
date: [TODAY'S DATE]
researcher: Assistant
topic: '[Research Topic]'
tags: [research, relevant, tags]
status: complete
confidence: high|medium|low
agents_used: [list of agents]
---

## Synopsis
[1-2 sentence summary]

## Summary
- Key finding 1
- Key finding 2
- Key finding 3

## Detailed Findings

### Codebase Analysis
[Implementation details with file:line references]

### Documentation Insights
[Past decisions, rationale, constraints]

### External Research
[Best practices, standards, alternatives]

## Code References
- `path/file.ext:12-45` - Description
- `path/other.ext:78` - Description

## Architecture Insights
[Patterns, design decisions, relationships]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [Priority action]

### Long-term Considerations
- [Strategic recommendation]

## Risks & Limitations
- [Identified risks]

## Open Questions
- [ ] [Unresolved questions]

## Confidence Assessment
Confidence: 0.X
Assumptions: [List assumptions]
Limitations: [List limitations]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All claims have file:line evidence
- [ ] Historical context included
- [ ] Open questions explicitly listed
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Confidence levels assigned
- [ ] Cross-component relationships identified

## Output

Save research document to `docs/research/[date]-[topic-slug].md`

Rate your confidence in the research findings (0-1) and identify any assumptions or limitations.

## Integration: --feed-into Workflow

When `--feed-into` is used:

1. **Save research document** to standard location
2. **Load research findings** as context for target command
3. **Automatically invoke** the next command with research context

Example:
```bash
/ai-eng/research "authentication patterns" --feed-into=specify
```

This:
1. Completes research phase
2. Saves to `docs/research/[date]-auth-patterns.md`
3. Invokes `/ai-eng/specify --from-research=docs/research/[date]-auth-patterns.md`

## Expert Context

You are a senior research analyst with 15+ years of experience at companies like Google, Stripe, and Netflix. Your expertise is in systematic investigation, pattern recognition, and synthesizing complex information into actionable insights.

**Take a deep breath and execute this research systematically.**
