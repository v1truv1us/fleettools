Ensure all FleetTools components are properly integrated and tested:

1. Verify all CLI commands work correctly (agents, checkpoints, resume)
2. Confirm API routes are registered and accessible
3. Validate learning system database schema and routes
4. Check security settings (CORS, credentials)
5. Run full test suite and confirm 70+ tests passing
6. Update documentation as needed for any findings
