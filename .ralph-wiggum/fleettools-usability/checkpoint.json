    "context": "Tech stack: TypeScript 5.9.3, Bun (>=1.0.0), SQLite/libSQL with Drizzle ORM 0.45.1, event-sourcing architecture. Architecture: Monorepo with CLI, Squawk (coordination), Server/API, editor plugins. Timeline: Critical for immediate AI agent coordination work - 1-2 week target with security as blocker. Requirements: Must maintain existing TypeScript/Bun architecture and AGENTS.md patterns, must complete all 72 tasks from comprehensive plan systematically, must achieve production-ready system with full agent coordination capability, must integrate with existing Podman for service management, must support FleetTools naming conventions (pilots/callsigns, not agents)",

    "output": "Location: specs/fleettools-usability/plan.md, Include: Immediate usability tasks with 15-30 minute granularity, security fixes as blockers, CLI completion focus, Task granularity: Fine-grained chunks designed for continuous iteration, Task format: Detailed with ID, dependencies, acceptance criteria, time estimate, complexity, and completion promise"
